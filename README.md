AWS App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy. It standardizes how microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high-availability for your applications.


Why use App Mesh?
Streamline operations by offloading communication management logic from application code and libraries into configurable infrastructure.
Reduce troubleshooting time required by having end-to-end visibility into service-level logs, metrics and traces across your application.
Easily roll out of new code by dynamically configuring routes to new application versions.
Ensure high-availability with custom routing rules that help ensure every service is highly available during deployments, after failures, and as your application scales.
Manage all service to service traffic using one set of APIs regardless of how the services are implemented.
